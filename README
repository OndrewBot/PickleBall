# pickleball-tournament
Creates a round-robin style pickleball tournament for paired games
ONGOING - NOT YET COMPLETE

_______________________________________________________________________________

Current round-robin algorithms can't mathematically design gameplay unless 1v1.
Assumptions:
1. at least 8 players
2. courts populated based on headcounts. If num%4 != 0, then 'byes' will be req'd
3. 'north' team serves, 'south' team receives 

Goals:
1. Player should not play with anyone more than once
2. Avoid having the same 4 players (paired differently) play back to back on the same court.
3. Player should ideally play same number of times north and south
4. Player should not have more than one bye
